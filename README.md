# robot-butler
This project involves the development of a robot butler for the French Door Cafe using ROS2. The robot is designed to autonomously handle food delivery tasks based on orders received by the host. It follows a series of steps to navigate between its home position, the kitchen, and customer tables. 
 Autonomous Navigation: Moving to designated locations without manual intervention.
 Task Confirmation: Waiting for confirmation at the kitchen or customer table before proceeding.
 Timeout Management: Returning to the home position after completing tasks or if a timeout occurs due to lack of confirmation.
